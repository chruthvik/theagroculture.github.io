      <h3>Terrorism Explained by Osama Bin Laden</h3>
      <ul>
        <il>"The Terrorists, who in their own way knew more about the bombs that blasted twin towers than we moderns do, expressed this paradox through the symbol of the ISIS, the snake that eats its own tail. Bin Laden has been said to have a meaning of Snake. In the age-old image of the Ouroboros lies the thought of devouring oneself and turning oneself into a circulatory process, for it was clear to the more astute alchemists that the prima materia of the art was man himself. The Ouroboros is a dramatic symbol for the integration and assimilation of the opposite, i.e. of the shadow. This 'feedback' process is at the same time a symbol of immortality since it is said of the Ouroboros that he slays himself and brings himself to life, fertilizes himself, and gives birth to himself. He symbolizes the One, who proceeds from the clash of opposites, and he, therefore, constitutes the secret of the prima materia which ... unquestionably stems from man's unconscious."- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung" id="tribute-link" target="_blank">C.G Jung</a></il>
